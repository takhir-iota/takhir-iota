### Takhir Adilzhanov

**Product leader who ships.** Co-Founder & CPO @ [IOTA](https://iota.uz) — building ERP/CRM systems and open-source infrastructure in Uzbekistan.

I don't write code — I vibe-code with AI agents and manage the teams that build production systems. Claude Code, OpenCode, and Cursor are my IDE. I think in systems, not tasks.

### What I do

🔧 **Build 0→1 products** — took startups from zero to $1M ARR. Product strategy, growth loops, pricing, positioning, launch.

🧠 **Systems thinking** — I see the whole machine. Architecture, team topology, feedback loops, unit economics. Not just features — foundations.

⚡ **Vibe coding** — I don't code in the traditional sense. I architect with AI agents (Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor), prototype in hours, and ship what used to take teams weeks. The future of product leadership is building, not just speccing.

🌍 **Emerging markets** — International business degree (Netherlands), PM in Moscow, product roles at US startups, now building in Central Asia. I know how to ship software where infrastructure fights you.

### Open Source

**[War Room](https://github.com/iota-uz/warroom)** — Put 6 frontier LLMs in a room and make them argue. Structured multi-model debate engine: DeepSeek, GPT, Opus, Gemini, Grok, Kimi go through 6 rounds of research → pitch → challenge → convergence → vote. Used for business strategy, creative ideation, and live Polymarket prediction analysis. Go + Bubble Tea TUI.

**[Agent Memory](https://github.com/takhir-iota/agent-memory)** — Your AI coding agents forget everything between sessions. This fixes that. Indexes Claude Code / OpenCode sessions into SQLite, auto-summarizes with Haiku, feeds context back. Zero cloud, zero auth, zero telemetry. Built because the existing solution (onecontext-ai) was shipping your data to a random Vercel backend.

**[Speak](https://github.com/iota-uz/speak)** — macOS menu bar dictation that actually works. Hotkey → talk → real-time text via Deepgram Nova-3. Faster and more accurate than Apple's built-in. Custom vocabulary for names and brands. ~$5/month.

**[IOTA SDK](https://github.com/iota-uz/iota-sdk)** — Open-source ERP/CRM for the Uzbekistan market. Modular Go backend, React frontend, PostgreSQL. What we use to run real businesses.

*I build the machine that builds the product.*

**Open to:** Advising, fractional CPO roles, and interesting 0→1 problems.
