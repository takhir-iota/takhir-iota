### hey, i'm takhir

i build products, grow them, and occasionally break things in interesting ways.

co-founder & cpo @ [iota](https://iota.uz) in tashkent. before that — product roles at us startups, pm work in moscow, business degree in the netherlands. i've been moving between countries and industries long enough to know that most problems are people problems, not tech problems.

### what i actually do

i'm a product person with solid tech understanding. right now i mostly steer ai systems in the right direction to extract real value fast.

day to day it's a mix of: product strategy, team building, ai pipelines, consulting, and building open source tools that scratch my own itch.

### some things i've built

**[careerist.com](https://careerist.com)** — edtech platform. built the career coaching mvp from scratch, 0→1.

**[ableapp.com](https://ableapp.com)** — healthtech startup. early product work, shaped the core experience.

**[aimlapi.com](https://aimlapi.com)** — unified ai/ml api platform. scaled from idea to solid revenue.

**[iota](https://iota.uz)** — co-founded. we build erp/crm systems and open-source tools for the uzbekistan market. real businesses run on what we ship.

**[granit](https://euroasia.uz)** — consulting for euroasia insurance on their digital platform. enterprise, regulations, the whole fun package.

### open source

**[war room](https://github.com/iota-uz/warroom)** — 6 frontier llms walk into a room and argue about your problem. structured debate engine: research → pitch → challenge → convergence → vote. strategy, creative, lifestyle, and polymarket presets. go + bubble tea.

**[agent memory](https://github.com/takhir-iota/agent-memory)** — ai coding agents forget everything between sessions. this fixes that. indexes sessions into sqlite, auto-summarizes, feeds context back. built it because the existing tool was shipping my data to some random vercel backend. no cloud, no auth, no telemetry.

**[speak](https://github.com/iota-uz/speak)** — macos dictation that doesn't suck. hotkey → talk → real-time text. deepgram nova-3, custom vocab. ~$5/month.

**[iota sdk](https://github.com/iota-uz/iota-sdk)** — open-source erp. go + react + postgres. modular, practical, boring in the best way.

### consulting

i help teams and companies with:

- **ai pipelines & rag systems** — safe, practical, production-grade.
- **product strategy** — 0→1, positioning, pricing, growth loops, when to say no.
- **team & tech architecture** — who to hire, what to build, what to buy.
- **corporate digital transformation** — enterprise systems that people actually use.

i'm not a consultant who writes decks. i build things and show you what works.

### vibes

i like systems thinking, emerging markets, open source, ai agents, weird side projects, and building things that matter to real people. i believe the best products come from people who use them.

open to interesting problems anywhere.
