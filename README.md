# Hi, I'm Takhir

Co-Founder & CPO at [IOTA](https://iota.uz) — a software company in Tashkent building ERP/CRM systems and an open-source ERP for the Uzbekistan market.

Product and growth leader. I manage teams, not write code. My background spans international business (Netherlands), project management (Moscow), and product roles at US startups (0 to $1M ARR). I build tools that sit at the intersection of AI and real workflows.

### Projects

**[War Room](https://github.com/iota-uz/warroom)** — Multi-LLM debate engine. Six frontier models (DeepSeek, GPT, Opus, Gemini, Grok, Kimi) argue through structured rounds to produce consensus strategies. Built in Go with a Bubble Tea TUI. Supports business strategy, creative ideation, lifestyle decisions, and live Polymarket prediction analysis.

**[Speak](https://github.com/iota-uz/speak)** — macOS menu bar dictation. Press a hotkey, talk, watch words appear in real-time via Deepgram Nova-3. Custom vocabulary for names and brands. Faster and more accurate than Apple's built-in voice typing. ~$5/month.

**[Agent Memory](https://github.com/takhir-iota/agent-memory)** — Local cross-session memory for Claude Code and OpenCode. Indexes coding sessions into SQLite, auto-summarizes with Claude Haiku, and feeds context back into future sessions. No cloud, no auth, no telemetry. Built as a privacy-respecting replacement for onecontext-ai.
